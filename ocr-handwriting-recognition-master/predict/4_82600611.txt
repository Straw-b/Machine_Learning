Dear Mark,
How is it going? I'm writing to tell you something about my good
friend.
My good friend is Cina. She is a student in our class. She
comes from America. She is thirteen years old. She 's pretty and
kind. She likes Chinese and she is good at it. Blue is her favourite
colour. She has a bluechoolbag and two blue pens.
Please write to me soon.
Yours
Liu Qiang
